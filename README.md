# Homework 10: Team Profile Generator

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

The **Team Profile Generator** is a Node.js command-line application that can easily build a software engineering team based off the employee information that we provide to `Inquirer.js`. Once the user prompts have been answered, a fully styled web page built with `HTML` and `CSS` will be generated and populated with our user data. 

## Installation

First run `npm init` to create a new package,

followed by `npm i` to install dependencies

## Usage

After our dependencies are successfully installed, we can run:

`node index.js` to initialize Inquirer.js

The user will be prompted to input their Manager's information, followed by a selection between adding an Engineer or Intern to the team.

Once the user hits 'Finish', all employee data will generate on to a fully designed web page containing color-coded employee cards for your team profile.

### User Story

    AS A manager
    I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
    SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

### Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
    WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
    THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
    WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
    THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
    WHEN I click on the GitHub username
    THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
    WHEN I start the application
    THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager‚Äôs name, employee ID, email address, and office number
    WHEN I enter the team manager‚Äôs name, employee ID, email address, and office number
    THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
    WHEN I select the engineer option
    THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer‚Äôs name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
    WHEN I select the intern option
    THEN I am prompted to enter the intern‚Äôs name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
    WHEN I decide to finish building my team
    THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
